# Model Card
Model Name: Scalable ML Pipeline with FastAPI

## Model Details
Version: 1.0.0  
Date: 02/24/2025  
Developers: MsDaniLani  
Repository: [Deploying a Scalable ML Pipeline with FastAPI](https://github.com/MsDaniLani/Deploying-a-Scalable-ML-Pipeline-with-FastAPI)  
License: Copyright Â© 2012 - 2020, Udacity, Inc.   
Model Type: Machine Learning Pipeline  

## Intended Use
Primary Use Case: To predict whether income exceeds $50K/year based on the provided census data. This project was developed for educational purposes and aimed at helping users learn about building, deploying, and scaling machine learning pipelines.  
  
Out-of-Scope Use Cases: This model is not intended for real-world applications or decision-making processes, as it lacks the comprehensive data for such scenarios. Further data collection and validation are recommended before considering real-life use.  
  
Target Audience: Data scientists, ML engineers, and developers looking to deploy scalable ML models using FastAPI.

## Training Data
The Census dataset provided by Udacity was used. It is publicly available and considered accurate for the purpose of this project.  

## Evaluation Data
The Census dataset provided by Udacity was used. It is publicly available and considered accurate for the purpose of this project.  

## Metrics
Precision: 0.7977  
Recall: 0.5292  
F1-Score: 0.6363  

## Ethical Considerations
Privacy: The model does not store or process personally identifiable information (PII).  

## Caveats and Recommendations
Increase the size of the training dataset to better capture the variability in income levels across different demographics.  
Assess the model for potential biases across different demographic groups and ensure fairness in predictions.
